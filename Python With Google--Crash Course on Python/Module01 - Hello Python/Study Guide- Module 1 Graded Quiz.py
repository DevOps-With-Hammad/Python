print(4**0.5) # To find the square root of a number

# to calculate how many different possible combination can be
# formed using a set of "x" characters with each character in "x"
# having "y" number of possible values, you will need to use an
# exponent for the calculation

x= 4
y= 26
print(y**6)

" Give it a try , Happy coding "


# Skill 3 --Use variables with assignment and arithmetic operators
#
# Assignment of values to the variables.
years =10
weeks_in_decade = 52
# This variable is assigned an arithmetic calculation
# print the calculation stored int the "weeks_in_year" variables
print(weeks_in_decade)
