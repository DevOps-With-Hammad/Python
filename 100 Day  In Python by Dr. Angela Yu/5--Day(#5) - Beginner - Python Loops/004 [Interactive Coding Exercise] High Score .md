# 004 [Interactive Coding Exercise] High Score
# App Insturction.
- you are going to write a programm that calculate the height score from a list of score.
- # e.g student_score = [78, 65, 89, 55, 91, 64, 89]
# Important  - you are not allowed to use th MAX or MIN function  the output word must match the example.

# The Height_Score in the class is :X
# Example Input
          [78, 65, 89, 55, 91, 64, 89]
# In this case the student input would look like that :
          [78, 65, 89, 55, 91, 64, 89]
# The heighgt_Score is = 91.
