# 004 [Interactive Coding Exercise] Paint Area Calculator
    you are painting a wall.
    The Instruction on the paint can say that ** (1) CAN of paint can  cover can cover a (5) square ** of meter on wall.
    Give a random height and width of walll, Calculate how many CANS you need to pay.
    
! Number of CANS = Height_of_wall * Width_of_wall / coverage_per_CAN.
# E.G:-
    Height_of_wall = 2
    Width_of_wall  = 5
- Number of CANS = Height_of_wall * Width_of_wall / coverage_per_CAN.
-     Number of CANS = (2*4) /5
-      Number of CANS = 1.6
- But because you can't buy a 0.6 CAN we can # ROUND it to 1 CAN .


# Let's Code ...
