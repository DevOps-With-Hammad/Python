# 1. Variables
# let's declare some variable here and print the type of them

# STR vars
name = "Python"
name1 = 'Programming '
name2 = str("code ")
# the 3 variables up there are str as you can see when printing them . also str can't run math process
print(name, name1, name2)
# Output >> Python Programming  code
# You can use the type using the Type () function to print out types of these variables
print(type(name), type(name1), type(name2))
# output >> <class 'str'> <class 'str'> <class 'str'>


# happy coding
